1. Climbing Stairs (with memoization)

You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top. Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. How many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

2. Coin Change (Count ways)

Given an amount and an array of coin denominations, find the number of ways to make the amount using the coins. You can use an unlimited number of each coin.

3. Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)

Given two strings, find the length of their longest common subsequence. Use recursion with memoization to optimize.

4. 0/1 Knapsack Problem

Given weights and values of items, and a maximum weight capacity, find the maximum value you can carry. Use recursion with memoization.

5. Unique Paths

You are at the top-left corner of an m x n grid. You can only move down or right. Find how many unique paths to reach the bottom-right corner.

6. Minimum Path Sum

Given a grid of non-negative numbers, find a path from top-left to bottom-right which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path. You can only move down or right.

7. Decode Ways

A message containing letters A-Z is encoded to numbers using 'A' -> 1, 'B' -> 2, ..., 'Z' -> 26. Given a digit string, count how many ways it can be decoded.

8. Edit Distance

Given two strings, find the minimum number of operations required to convert one string into the other. Operations can be insert, remove, or replace a character.

9. Partition Problem

Given a set of integers, determine if it can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is the same.

10. Palindrome Partitioning

Given a string, partition it such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome. Return the minimum cuts needed for a palindrome partitioning of the string.
